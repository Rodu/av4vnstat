Visualizing vnstat data using the d3 data visualization library (http://bost.ocks.org/mike/)  

The simple project is an experiment with the d3 (http://mbostock.github.com/d3/)
data visualization library.

Starting from the code contained in the Stacked Bars example in the d3 library distribution
(version 2.1.3) the visualization uses the data registered by vnstat, network traffic monitor
tool that can be used on a Linux machine, to show the amount of traffic in download and upload
related to a specific network interface.

The idea is to have a cron job running a python script that reads the vnstat data and creates
a javascript data set to be used in the web page containing the chart.

Using the d3 library the Stacked Bars visualization will be drawn using SVG.
