av4vnstat - Another Viewer for vnstat

Visualizing vnstat data using the Highcharts Javascript library:
http://www.highcharts.com

The application allows to visualize the data collected by vnstat, network traffic
monitor tool.
Vnstat can be used on a Linux machine, to register the amount of traffic in
download and upload for a specific network interface.

The Av4vnstat uses a Python program to parse those data and create specific
datasets to be consumed in the Javascript web app.

The idea is to have a cron job running the python script to read the vnstat data
and update the Javascript dataset at regular intervals.

Using the Highchart library basic charts and some visualizations will show
the data.

For setup instructions see the SETUP file.
